# Disco King 
The program is a platformer in which our disco man traverses through 3 different worlds to fight the final boss.
He starts in the city, and is gradually introduced to both enemies, that he must shoot with his assault rifle,
and powerups, which he must collect to aid him on his journey. He then enters the disco world and there is tested
concerning his skill and will to survive. Finally he makes it to the Volcano world, in which he will navigate the
dangerous terrain and finish off the boss.
